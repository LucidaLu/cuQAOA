# cuQAOA: A CUDA-based QAOA Simulator

**cuQAOA** is a CUDA-based QAOA Simulator, which implements state vector simulation of QAOA using Fast Walshâ€“Hadamard Transform.

In this project, we implement CUDA programs with the help of [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) library. So in order to use this project, you need to have numba installed following [Numba offical documentation](https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/installing.html), and make sure CUDA GPU support for Numba is enabled.

**Usage:**
```py
